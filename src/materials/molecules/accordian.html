<p>Students also have the right to establish a voluntary student organization, or to lead an activity that promotes equality and non-discrimination. This may include, but is not limited to, organizations such as gay-straight alliances, diversity clubs, anti-racism clubs and anti-bullying clubs. Students may select a respectful and inclusive name for the organization, including the name “gay-straight alliance” or “queer-straight alliance”, after consulting with the principal.</p></span>
